Indoor navigation
-----------------

The exploration of the 3D reconstruction of the indoor portion of Bastione San Giacomo was defined through a series of actions included into annotations.

In particular, the following actions were implemented:

* Changing view and scene;
* Showing image pop-up;
* Playing animations.

Changing view and scene
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This action is implemented in the *Start exploring!* annotation located in the center of the entrance.
Its goal is to trigger the movement from the indoor environment to the outdoor scene.

In order to do so, an input button element is defined in the annotation name.
Then, the action is defined by defining the series of operations to be executed when the button whose name is "outdoor" is clicked by the user.

This event will first call the function *changeHotspotName()*, changing the hotspot name to the one of the reference point of interest on which the new scene will be focused.
In this case, it will be the outdoor of the San Giacomo bastion. So, the name to be included within the brackets is "San Giacomo".

Hence, the *moveHere()* method of the Annotation class is applied to the third element ([2]) of the annotation list defined in the *loadannotations.js* file.
In this case, it was needed to switch to the camera view defined in the Bastione San Giacomo annotation that was defined as the third in the js file.
By applying this method, the new view will automatically be set considering the coordinates and orientations included in the referred annotation.

Eventually, the visibility of annotations is changed according to the new view.
Consequently, the visible property of all the annotation children defined inside the bastion is set to *false*, while the one of the new outdoor scene annotations is changed to *true*.

Showing image pop-up
++++++++++++++++++++

The orbit icon included in the indoor annotations is associated to an image detail.
Indeed, after clicking on it, the platform shows a pop up with the image attached to the annotation of interest.
To return to the navigation scene, the user could simply click on the faded area outside the shown image.
