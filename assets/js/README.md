# Assets - js

In this folder you could find some examples of js scripts for importing and defining features in the Potree environment.

In particular:
- [loadannotations](loadannotations.js) helps defining Potree annotations, including implementing descriptions with assets (images, video, link etc.) and actions on titles.
- [loadpointclouds](loadpointclouds.js) defines parameters for importing in sequence the needed pointclouds with the desired visualisation settings.
- [loadpphotos](loadphotos.js) is the script for loading in different chunks images oriented on the model, captured by different devices/equipments.
- [loadanimations](loadanimations.js) gives a template for defining a set of predefined camera animation paths in the Potree scene.
