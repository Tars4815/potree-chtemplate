 This folder **img_selected** is used to manage the selection of images 
 within the `js/loadphotos` functions. It refers to folders containing 
 images and associated files necessary for camera calibration and 
 camera orientation in visualising in the 3D scene the pictures of interest. When the repository is downloaded for local testing, 
 oriented images of interest need to be copied.
