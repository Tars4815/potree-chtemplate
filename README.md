# potree-CHtemplate

An updated template for Potree pages based on [Vizcaya Museum](https://github.com/VizcayaMuseum/Kiosk) project and inspired by [potree-sfm](https://github.com/hokiespurs/potree-sfm) project features.

A working example can be found on the [LabMGF DICA PoliMi website](https://labmgf.dica.polimi.it/pujob/potree-template/).

The project has been originally developed by **LAB2R** (Laboratory of Survey and Representation) coordinated by Professor [Livio Pinto](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Livio-Pinto) at Politecnico di Milano - Piacenza campus.

The in situ survey was part of the laboratories for the [**RELIEF TECHNIQUE AND 3D MODELING FOR THE ARCHITECTURE**](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=735710&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=93e89e7f2db93a52f4de53beb4e38ea2) course from the Bachelor of Science Degree in Architectural Design. Drone surveys and laser scanner acquisitions were conducted and pre-processed by [Federico Barbieri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-barbieri-8006a0228/) and [Francesco Ioli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-ioli-640061160/)

The collected data were first processed within the research thesis project entitled *Riscoprire il gigante sommerso - Rilievo, indagine storica e ricostruzione digitale del Castello di Pierluigi Farnese by Michele Dondi and Clara Rivieri.* by Michele Dondi and Clara Rivieri.

The digital twin platform implementation was carried by [Federica Gaspari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicagaspari/).
